# Task 5: Understanding pipeline failures

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Learn how to debug broken pipelines.

1. How you found the error
   - I pushed the changes and saw that the test failed

2. How you fixed it
   - I looked at the log to identify what the issue was and where it was in the code

3. How you verified the pipeline was green
   - I fixed the broken code pushed the changes and went back to the log to check that everything run smoothly

# Establish Staging - The Permanent Test Environment

Here is the link to the permanent Staging URL: https://red-hill-0844a3903.1.azurestaticapps.net/
This link should be shared with stakeholders and product owners because it is more stable. The url preview is temporary and is mainly for code reviews. 

# Tool Choice

I chose Vercel for my production environment due to its seamless integration with GitHub, which allows for automatic deployments from my repository. Vercel's optimization for modern frontend frameworks ensures that my application performs efficiently. The global CDN enhances load times, and the ease of use provides a great developer experience. The ability to preview deployments before merging changes also facilitates better collaboration and quality assurance.

# Delivery to Production - (CD)

# Environemt Separation for Backend (Isolation)

In production applications, it is important to separate environments to ensure stability and security. 
- **API-PROD** is isolated from **API-DEV** to prevent any potential issues in development from affecting the live application.
- This separation allows for safe testing and development without the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities into the production environment.
- It also allows easier management of resources and configurations specific to each environment.
